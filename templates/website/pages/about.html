    <h2>How it works</h2>
        
        <p class="big">Helping lazy people learn fast.</p>
        
        <p>Too often, I lookup a word, then forget it a day later. When I want to use it again, it's gone, and I kick myself for not studying hard enough.</p>
        
        <p>If that's you too, this is your dictionary.</p>
        
        <p>Using spaced repetition techniques, we remember the words you search for and schedule optimised vocabulary reviews and tests.</p>
        
        <p>For example:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>You search for a word.</li>
        <li>Tomorrow, we'll send you a review request, where you get another chance to view the characters, pronunciation and meaning.</li>
        <li>Maybe three days later you get a test request - here we'll see if you can remember the pronunciation and meaning.</li>
        </ol>
      
        <p>If you pass the test, the next test is scheduled for a bit further away - say 5 days. The more you pass, the larger the test interval becomes. If you fail the test, we schedule another review immediately and reset the test interval.</p>
        
        <p>You save time by only testing words that you struggle with. You never have to waste time preparing long vocabulary lists and remembering when to test each item. Plus, it's vocabulary <em>you've looked up</em>, meaning it's relevant to your life and study. </p>
