        <p class="big">
            1. <br/>You search for words and get answers
            <br/>
            <span class="sub">
                Lookup words using English, Chinese or <em>pinyin</em> and you'll get character definitions, word examples, pronunciation guides and more, just like you'd expect from a standard Chinese dictionary.

            2. <br/>We schedule reviews and tests

            <span class="sub">
                We build up your personal wordlist, and based on spaced repetition algorithms and adjusting for your individual abilities, we schedule reviews and tests at exactly the right time so you do as little study as possible, but also remember as much as possible.
            </span>
        </p>

            3. <br/>You get notified when you need to test something.

            <span class="sub">
                Whenever you need to review or test a vocabulary item, we email you. You click on a link, take a very, very short test and then that's it. You spend the minimum amount of time learning, and absolutely zero time writing flashcards, scheduling your learning, copying from notebooks...

        <p>Effective memorisation is a simple technique, but we typically pick up terrible habits at school - cramming for tests, huge piles of flashcards or thick books, several hour study sessions...</p>

        <p>In reality, memorisation requires that you repeatedly learn and then recall (remember) something at exactly the right time for it to bury itself deeper and deeper in your memory. </p>
