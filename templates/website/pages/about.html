<p class="big">Dictionaries suck. How many times have you looked up a word, forgotten it, and then <span style="text-decoration:underline">blamed yourself</span> for not studying hard enough? No - blame that lazy, part-time, good-for-nothing dictionary you bought.</p>

<p>This is a simple dictionary that <strong>pro-actively</strong> helps you remember and learn new words.</p>



<ul>
    <li>Search and use just like a normal online dictionary</li>
    <li>We keep a record of all the vocabulary you look up.</li>
    <li>Then the magic starts...</li>
</ul>

<p>Using spaced repetition techniques and a variety of learning strategies, we ensure that every time you look up a word, it becomes part of your own personal language curriculum.</p>
