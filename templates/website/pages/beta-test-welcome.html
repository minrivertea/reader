<h1>Welcome Beta Tester!</h1>

<p>We're going to try make learning Chinese vocabulary easier for you. Thanks for taking part - here's a little introduction to this whole thing (2 minutes tops).</p>

<hr/>

<div class="section pure-u-1 text-left" id="get_started">
    <p class="big">This is a Chinese-English dictionary that helps you learn vocabulary faster and with less effort.</p>
    <p><strong>1. </strong>You use it like any other dictionary - search for words using Chinese, pinyin or English.</p>
    <p><strong>2. </strong>The tool remembers the words you've searched for, and sends you emails when you need to test/review something.</p>
    <p><strong>3. </strong>Using <a href="{% url 'page' 'spaced-repetition' %}">Spaced Repetition</a> techniques, we optimise and automate your learning so you put in minimum effort with maximum results.</p>

<div class="section pure-u-1 text-left" id="how_it_works">
    <p class="big">For the next month, we want you to use this as your main Chinese-English dictionary.</p>
    
    <p>It's completely free and hopefully will help improve your Chinese vocabulary.</p>
        
    <p>Because this is a very early test, you'll definitely bump into bugs, errors or some not-perfect features! Please try your best to stick with it and email us at <a href="mailto:info@chinesedictionary.io">info@chinesedictionary.io</a> or use the Weixin (WeChat) group to give feedback.</p>
